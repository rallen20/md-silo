## Supervised machine learning
> finds patterns between data and labels(organization of data into 'species') that can be expressed mathematically as functions

> given an input, functions tells the system what the expected outcome is, thus, supervise training

> ML system learns patterns on this labeled data, in the future the ML system will be able to make predictions on data not from the training set
